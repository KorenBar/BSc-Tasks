oryOutlineGlossarategoryteComputer science is the study of a
lgorithmic processes, computational machines and computation
 itself.[1] As a discipline, computer science spans a range 
of topics from theoretical studies of algorithms, computatio
n and information to the practical issues of implementing co
mputational systems in hardware and software.[2][3]Its field
s can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines.
 For example, the theory of computation concerns abstract mo
dels of computation and general classes of problems that can
 be solved using them, while computer graphics or computatio
nal geometry emphasize more specific applications. Algorithm
s and data structures have been called the heart of computer
 science.[4] Programming language theory considers approache
s to the description of computational processes, while compu
ter programming involves the use of them to create complex s
ystems. Computer architecture describes construction of comp
uter components and computer-operated equipment. Artificial 
intelligence aims to synthesize goal-orientated processes su
ch as problem-solving, decision-making, environmental adapta
tion, planning and learning found in humans and animals. A d
igital computer is capable of simulating various information
 processes.[5] The fundamental concern of computer science i
s determining what can and cannot be automated.[6] Computer 
scientists usually focus on academic research. The Turing Aw
ard is generally recognized as the highest distinction in co
mputer sciences.Contents1	History2	Etymology3	Philosophy4	Fi

sary of computer scienceCategory CategoryvteCharles Babbage,
 sometimes referred to as the "father of computing".[7]Ada L
ovelace published the first algorithm intended for processin
g on a computer.[8]The earliest foundations of what would be
come computer science predate the invention of the modern di
gital computer. Machines for calculating fixed numerical tas
ks such as the abacus have existed since antiquity, aiding i
n computations such as multiplication and division. Algorith
ms for performing computations have existed since antiquity,
 even before the development of sophisticated computing equi
pment.Wilhelm Schickard designed and constructed the first w
orking mechanical calculator in 1623.[9] In 1673, Gottfried 
Leibniz demonstrated a digital mechanical calculator, called
 the Stepped Reckoner.[10] Leibniz may be considered the fir
st computer scientist and information theorist, for, among o
ther reasons, documenting the binary number system. In 1820,
 Thomas de Colmar launched the mechanical calculator industr
y[note 1] when he invented his simplified arithmometer, the 
first calculating machine strong enough and reliable enough 
to be used daily in an office environment. Charles Babbage s
tarted the design of the first automatic mechanical calculat
or, his Difference Engine, in 1822, which eventually gave hi
m the idea of the first programmable mechanical calculator, 
his Analytical Engine.[11] He started developing this machin
e in 1834, and "in less than two years, he had sketched out 
many of the salient features of the modern computer".[12] "A
 crucial step was the adoption of a punched card system deri
ved from the Jacquard loom"[12] making it infinitely program
mable.[note 2] In 1843, during the translation of a French a
rticle on the Analytical Engine, Ada Lovelace wrote, in one 
of the many notes she included, an algorithm to compute the 
Bernoulli numbers, which is considered to be the first publi
shed algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation
 on a computer.[13] Around 1885, Herman Hollerith invented t
he tabulator, which used punched cards to process statistica
l information; eventually his company became part of IBM. Fo
llowing Babbage, although unaware of his earlier work, Percy
 Ludgate in 1909 published [14] the 2nd of the only two desi
gns for mechanical analytical engines in history. In 1937, o
ne hundred years after Babbage's impossible dream, Howard Ai
ken convinced IBM, which was making all kinds of punched car
d equipment and was also in the calculator business[15] to d
evelop his giant programmable calculator, the ASCC/Harvard M
ark I, based on Babbage's Analytical Engine, which itself us
ed cards and a central computing unit. When the machine was 
finished, some hailed it as "Babbage's dream come true".[16]
During the 1940s, with the development of new and more power
ful computing machines such as the Atanasoff‚ÄìBerry compute
r and ENIAC, the term computer came to refer to the machines
 rather than their human predecessors.[17] As it became clea
r that computers could be used for more than just mathematic
al calculations, the field of computer science broadened to 
study computation in general. In 1945, IBM founded the Watso
n Scientific Computing Laboratory at Columbia University in 
New York City. The renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's
 West Side was IBM's first laboratory devoted to pure scienc
e. The lab is the forerunner of IBM's Research Division, whi
ch today operates research facilities around the world.[18] 
Ultimately, the close relationship between IBM and the unive
rsity was instrumental in the emergence of a new scientific 
discipline, with Columbia offering one of the first academic
-credit courses in computer science in 1946.[19] Computer sc
ience began to be established as a distinct academic discipl
ine in the 1950s and early 1960s.[20][21] The world's first 
computer science degree program, the Cambridge Diploma in Co
mputer Science, began at the University of Cambridge Compute
r Laboratory in 1953. The first computer science department 
in the United States was formed at Purdue University in 1962
.[22] Since practical computers became available, many appli
cations of computing have become distinct areas of study in 
their own rights.See also: History of computing and History 
of informaticsEtymologySee also: Informatics ¬ß EtymologyAlt
hough first proposed in 1956,[23] the term "computer science
" appears in a 1959 article in Communications of the ACM,[24
] in which Louis Fein argues for the creation of a Graduate 
School in Computer Sciences analogous to the creation of Har
vard Business School in 1921,[25] justifying the name by arg
uing that, like management science, the subject is applied a
nd interdisciplinary in nature, while having the characteris
tics typical of an academic discipline.[24] His efforts, and
 those of others such as numerical analyst George Forsythe, 
were rewarded: universities went on to create such departmen
ts, starting with Purdue in 1962.[26] Despite its name, a si
gnificant amount of computer science does not involve the st
udy of computers themselves. Because of this, several altern
ative names have been proposed.[27] Certain departments of m
ajor universities prefer the term computing science, to emph
asize precisely that difference. Danish scientist Peter Naur
 suggested the term datalogy,[28] to reflect the fact that t
he scientific discipline revolves around data and data treat
ment, while not necessarily involving computers. The first s
cientific institution to use the term was the Department of 
Datalogy at the University of Copenhagen, founded in 1969, w
ith Peter Naur being the first professor in datalogy. The te
rm is used mainly in the Scandinavian countries. An alternat
ive term, also proposed by Naur, is data science; this is no
w used for a multi-disciplinary field of data analysis, incl
uding statistics and databases.In the early days of computin
g, a number of terms for the practitioners of the field of c
omputing were suggested in the Communications of the ACM‚Äît
uringineer, turologist, flow-charts-man, applied meta-mathem
atician, and applied epistemologist.[29] Three months later 
in the same journal, comptologist was suggested, followed ne
xt year by hypologist.[30] The term computics has also been 
suggested.[31] In Europe, terms derived from contracted tran
slations of the expression "automatic information" (e.g. "in
formazione automatica" in Italian) or "information and mathe
matics" are often used, e.g. informatique (French), Informat
ik (German), informatica (Italian, Dutch), inform√°tica (Spa
nish, Portuguese), informatika (Slavic languages and Hungari
an) or pliroforiki (œÄŒªŒ∑œÅŒøœÜŒøœÅŒπŒ∫ŒÆ, which means info
rmatics) in Greek. Similar words have also been adopted in t
he UK (as in the School of Informatics of the University of 
Edinburgh).[32] "In the U.S., however, informatics is linked
 with applied computing, or computing in the context of anot
her domain."[33]A folkloric quotation, often attributed to‚Ä
îbut almost certainly not first formulated by‚ÄîEdsger Dijks
tra, states that "computer science is no more about computer
s than astronomy is about telescopes."[note 3] The design an
d deployment of computers and computer systems is generally 
considered the province of disciplines other than computer s
cience. For example, the study of computer hardware is usual
ly considered part of computer engineering, while the study 
of commercial computer systems and their deployment is often
 called information technology or information systems. Howev
er, there has been much cross-fertilization of ideas between
 the various computer-related disciplines. Computer science 
research also often intersects other disciplines, such as ph
ilosophy, cognitive science, linguistics, mathematics, physi
cs, biology, Earth science, statistics, and logic.Computer s
cience is considered by some to have a much closer relations
hip with mathematics than many scientific disciplines, with 
some observers saying that computing is a mathematical scien
ce.[20] Early computer science was strongly influenced by th
e work of mathematicians such as Kurt G√∂del, Alan Turing, J
ohn von Neumann, R√≥zsa P√©ter and Alonzo Church and there c
ontinues to be a useful interchange of ideas between the two
 fields in areas such as mathematical logic, category theory
, domain theory, and algebra.[23]The relationship between Co
mputer Science and Software Engineering is a contentious iss
ue, which is further muddied by disputes over what the term 
"Software Engineering" means, and how computer science is de
fined.[34] David Parnas, taking a cue from the relationship 
between other engineering and science disciplines, has claim
ed that the principal focus of computer science is studying 
the properties of computation in general, while the principa
l focus of software engineering is the design of specific co
mputations to achieve practical goals, making the two separa
te but complementary disciplines.[35]The academic, political
, and funding aspects of computer science tend to depend on 
whether a department is formed with a mathematical emphasis 
or with an engineering emphasis. Computer science department
s with a mathematics emphasis and with a numerical orientati
on consider alignment with computational science. Both types
 of departments tend to make efforts to bridge the field edu
cationally if not across all research.PhilosophyMain article
: Philosophy of computer scienceA number of computer scienti
sts have argued for the distinction of three separate paradi
gms in computer science. Peter Wegner argued that those para
digms are science, technology, and mathematics.[36] Peter De
nning's working group argued that they are theory, abstracti
on (modeling), and design.[37] Amnon H. Eden described them 
as the "rationalist paradigm" (which treats computer science
 as a branch of mathematics, which is prevalent in theoretic
al computer science, and mainly employs deductive reasoning)
, the "technocratic paradigm" (which might be found in engin
eering approaches, most prominently in software engineering)
, and the "scientific paradigm" (which approaches computer-r
elated artifacts from the empirical perspective of natural s
ciences, identifiable in some branches of artificial intelli
gence).[38] Computer science focuses on methods involved in 
design, specification, programming, verification, implementa
tion and testing of human-made computing systems.[39]FieldsC
omputer science is no more about computers than astronomy is
 about telescopes.‚Äî‚ÄâEdsger DijkstraFurther information: 
Outline of computer scienceAs a discipline, computer science
 spans a range of topics from theoretical studies of algorit
hms and the limits of computation to the practical issues of
 implementing computing systems in hardware and software.[40
][41] CSAB, formerly called Computing Sciences Accreditation
 Board‚Äîwhich is made up of representatives of the Associat
ion for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Soc
iety (IEEE CS)[42]‚Äîidentifies four areas that it considers
 crucial to the discipline of computer science: theory of co
mputation, algorithms and data structures, programming metho
dology and languages, and computer elements and architecture
. In addition to these four areas, CSAB also identifies fiel
ds such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, co
mputer networking and communication, database systems, paral
lel computation, distributed computation, human‚Äìcomputer i
nteraction, computer graphics, operating systems, and numeri
cal and symbolic computation as being important areas of com
puter science.[40]Theoretical computer scienceMain article: 
Theoretical computer scienceTheoretical Computer Science is 
mathematical and abstract in spirit, but it derives its moti
vation from the practical and everyday computation. Its aim 
is to understand the nature of computation and, as a consequ
ence of this understanding, provide more efficient methodolo
gies.Theory of computationMain article: Theory of computatio
nAccording to Peter Denning, the fundamental question underl
ying computer science is, "What can be automated?"[20] Theor
y of computation is focused on answering fundamental questio
ns about what can be computed and what amount of resources a
re required to perform those computations. In an effort to a
nswer the first question, computability theory examines whic
h computational problems are solvable on various theoretical
 models of computation. The second question is addressed by 
computational complexity theory, which studies the time and 
space costs associated with different approaches to solving 
a multitude of computational problems.The famous P = NP? pro
blem, one of the Millennium Prize Problems,[43] is an open p
roblem in the theory of computation.DFAexample.svg	Syntax tr

heory and Coding theoryInformation theory, closely related t
o probability and statistics, is related to the quantificati
on of information. This was developed by Claude Shannon to f
ind fundamental limits on signal processing operations such 
as compressing data and on reliably storing and communicatin
g data.[44] Coding theory is the study of the properties of 
codes (systems for converting information from one form to a
nother) and their fitness for a specific application. Codes 
are used for data compression, cryptography, error detection
 and correction, and more recently also for network coding. 
Codes are studied for the purpose of designing efficient and
 reliable data transmission methods. [45]Hamming.jpg	Binary

 theory and Formal methodsProgramming language theory is a b
ranch of computer science that deals with the design, implem
entation, analysis, characterization, and classification of 
programming languages and their individual features. It fall
s within the discipline of computer science, both depending 
on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, and ling
uistics. It is an active research area, with numerous dedica
ted academic journals.Formal methods are a particular kind o
f mathematically based technique for the specification, deve
lopment and verification of software and hardware systems.[4
6] The use of formal methods for software and hardware desig
n is motivated by the expectation that, as in other engineer
ing disciplines, performing appropriate mathematical analysi
s can contribute to the reliability and robustness of a desi
gn. They form an important theoretical underpinning for soft
ware engineering, especially where safety or security is inv
olved. Formal methods are a useful adjunct to software testi
ng since they help avoid errors and can also give a framewor
k for testing. For industrial use, tool support is required.
 However, the high cost of using formal methods means that t
hey are usually only used in the development of high-integri
ty and life-critical systems, where safety or security is of
 utmost importance. Formal methods are best described as the
 application of a fairly broad variety of theoretical comput
er science fundamentals, in particular logic calculi, formal
 languages, automata theory, and program semantics, but also
 type systems and algebraic data types to problems in softwa
re and hardware specification and verification.IF-THEN-ELSE-

tificial intelligence (AI) aims to or is required to synthes

ion-making, environmental adaptation, learning, and communic
ation found in humans and animals. From its origins in cyber
netics and in the Dartmouth Conference (1956), artificial in
telligence research has been necessarily cross-disciplinary,
 drawing on areas of expertise such as applied mathematics, 
symbolic logic, semiotics, electrical engineering, philosoph
y of mind, neurophysiology, and social intelligence. AI is a
ssociated in the popular mind with robotic development, but 
the main field of practical application has been as an embed
ded component in areas of software development, which requir
e computational understanding. The starting point in the lat
e 1940s was Alan Turing's question "Can computers think?", a
nd the question remains effectively unanswered, although the
 Turing test is still used to assess computer output on the 
scale of human intelligence. But the automation of evaluativ
e and predictive tasks has been increasingly successful as a
 substitute for human monitoring and intervention in domains
 of computer application involving complex real-world data.N

philosopher of computing Bill Rapaport noted three Great Ins
ights of Computer Science:[52]Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz's, G
eorge Boole's, Alan Turing's, Claude Shannon's, and Samuel M
orse's insight: there are only two objects that a computer h
as to deal with in order to represent "anything".[note 4]All
 the information about any computable problem can be represe
nted using only 0 and 1 (or any other bistable pair that can
 flip-flop between two easily distinguishable states, such a
s "on/off", "magnetized/de-magnetized", "high-voltage/low-vo
ltage", etc.).See also: Digital physicsAlan Turing's insight
: there are only five actions that a computer has to perform
 in order to do "anything".Every algorithm can be expressed 
in a language for a computer consisting of only five basic i
nstructions:[53]move left one location;move right one locati
on;read symbol at current location;print 0 at current locati
on;print 1 at current location.See also: Turing machineCorra
do B√∂hm and Giuseppe Jacopini's insight: there are only thr
ee ways of combining these actions (into more complex ones) 
that are needed in order for a computer to do "anything".[54
]Only three rules are needed to combine any set of basic ins
tructions into more complex ones:sequence: first do this, th
en do that;selection: IF such-and-such is the case, THEN do 
this, ELSE do that;repetition: WHILE such-and-such is the ca
se, DO this.Note that the three rules of Boehm's and Jacopin
i's insight can be further simplified with the use of goto (
which means it is more elementary than structured programmin
g).See also: Structured program theoremProgramming paradigms
Main article: Programming paradigmProgramming languages can 
be used to accomplish different tasks in different ways. Com
mon programming paradigms include:Functional programming, a 
style of building the structure and elements of computer pro
grams that treats computation as the evaluation of mathemati
cal functions and avoids state and mutable data. It is a dec
larative programming paradigm, which means programming is do
ne with expressions or declarations instead of statements.[5
5]Imperative programming, a programming paradigm that uses s
tatements that change a program's state.[56] In much the sam
e way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresse
s commands, an imperative program consists of commands for t
he computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on de
scribing how a program operates.Object-oriented programming,
 a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", w
hich may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as
 attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often know
n as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's proce
dures can access and often modify the data fields of the obj
ect with which they are associated. Thus object-oriented com
puter programs are made out of objects that interact with on
e another.[57]Service-oriented programming, a programming pa
radigm that uses "services" as the unit of computer work, to
 design and implement integrated business applications and m
ission critical software programsMany languages offer suppor
t for multiple paradigms, making the distinction more a matt
er of style than of technical capabilities.[58]AcademiaFurth

s, in computer science, the prestige of conference papers is
 greater than that of journal publications.[59][60] One prop
osed explanation for this is the quick development of this r
elatively new field requires rapid review and distribution o
f results, a task better handled by conferences than by jour
nals.[61]EducationMain article: Computer science educationCo
mputer Science, known by its near synonyms, Computing, Compu
ter Studies, has been taught in UK schools since the days of
 batch processing, mark sensitive cards and paper tape but u
sually to a select few students.[62] In 1981, the BBC produc
ed a micro-computer and classroom network and Computer Studi
es became common for GCE O level students (11‚Äì16-year-old)
, and Computer Science to A level students. Its importance w
as recognised, and it became a compulsory part of the Nation
al Curriculum, for Key Stage 3 & 4. In September 2014 it bec
ame an entitlement for all pupils over the age of 4.[63]In t
he US, with 14,000 school districts deciding the curriculum,
 provision was fractured.[64] According to a 2010 report by 
the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Computer S
cience Teachers Association (CSTA), only 14 out of 50 states
 have adopted significant education standards for high schoo
l computer science.[65]Israel, New Zealand, and South Korea 
have included computer science in their national secondary e
ducation curricula,[66][67] and several others are following

The introduction of punched cards into the new engine was im
portant not only as a more convenient form of control than t
he drums, or because programs could now be of unlimited exte
nt, and could be stored and repeated without the danger of i
ntroducing errors in setting the machine by hand; it was imp
ortant also because it served to crystallize Babbage's feeli
ng that he had invented something really new, something much
 more than a sophisticated calculating machine." Bruce Colli
er, 1970 See the entry "Computer science" on Wikiquote for t
he history of this quotation. The word "anything" is written
 in quotation marks because there are things that computers 
cannot do. One example is: to answer the question if an arbi
trary given computer program will eventually finish or run f
orever (the Halting problem).References "What is Computer Sc
